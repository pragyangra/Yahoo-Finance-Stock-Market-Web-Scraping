# Yahoo-Finance-Stock-Market-Web-Scraping

I have recently started learning about trading and so I thought this what my web scraping project should be on. Being an analyst I know the important data holds and I know how much insight I could gain from data. However the first step would always be 'extracting the data'. This extracted data could further be used for creating a data pipeline, performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, and conducting in-depth analysis.

The project is in these separate files. The file "Scraped Data" contains three csv files consisting of the final data extracted from the Yahoo Finance website. The scraping process involves the creation of a requests object that gets the contents of the webpage. We use particular tags and keywords to find the data that we need and finally compile all the data into a dataframe which is later exported in csv format for analytical use.
